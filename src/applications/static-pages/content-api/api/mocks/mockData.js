          '<p>Our medical center and five Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) in Delaware and southern New Jersey remain open, safe and are ready to care for your medical needs. As we move forward in providing care, please understand that we have made changes to promote safety in our facilities. We continue to implement and practice enhanced safety measures, including physical distancing, masking and limiting the number of patients utilizing waiting room space to keep you and our staff safe.<br /><br />\nIf you plan on coming to our medical center or CBOCs, please help us protect our Veterans and staff by following the requirement of anyone entering must wear a face covering or mask. Please call ahead to notify us of your health care needs at <strong>1-800-461-8262</strong>, select Option <strong>2</strong>. During this time, we want to discourage “walks-ins” and prefer that all care be scheduled during Phase 1 of our Moving Forward Plan. <br />\n </p>\n\n<p><strong>Virtual Care</strong><br />\nDuring this pandemic, we have relied more on virtual care than ever before. Feedback has been very positive, and we encourage you to continue to utilize virtual care as necessary to continue to receive health care. Please call <strong>1-800-461-8262</strong>, select Option <strong>2</strong>, to make virtual appointments. We also encourage you to contact us using secure messaging through MyHealth<em>e</em>Vet. More details on how you can coordinate care through safe, secure web-based messaging can be found on the next page.<br /><br /><strong>Scheduling Appointments</strong><br /><strong><em>Please schedule all your appointments including blood work and x-rays prior to coming to any of our facilities.</em></strong> To promote safety, we continue to discourage walk ins and ask that you please contact us via phone at <strong>1-800-461-8262</strong>, select Option <strong>2</strong>, so we can better coordinate your care. We will gradually increase service capacity during each phase as we move forward.<br /><br />\nIf you need appointments in more than one clinical area, we will try to schedule them on the same day in order to prevent multiple trips to our facilities. Please contact the facility at the above number to consolidate your all your appointments.<br /><br /><strong>Visitation</strong><br />\nTo ensure the health and safety of our Veterans, staff and visitors, we’re currently following CDC guidelines and limiting visitors for patients receiving care at Wilmington VA Medical Center. Limiting outside visitors helps us protect older Veterans and those who already have health issues.<br /><br />\nIf you want or need a family member or friend to be a part of a scheduled health care visit, please let us know ahead of time so we can safely prepare for their participation. We do make an exception for Veterans who qualify as an end-of-life "compassionate case."<br /><br /><strong>Secure Messaging/MyHealth<em>e</em>Vet</strong> <br />\nSecure Messaging is a safe and secure web-based messaging service. Secure Messaging allows you to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Ask <strong>non-urgent</strong>, <strong>non-emergency</strong> health related questions.</li>\n\t<li>Update your VA health care team on your health condition.</li>\n\t<li>Request VA referrals and medication renewals.</li>\n\t<li>Manage your VA appointments.</li>\n\t<li>Ask routine administrative questions.</li>\n\t<li>More information can be found at <a href="http://www.myhealthevet.va.gov/">www.myhealthevet.va.gov</a>.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Rx Refills</strong> <br />\nThere are several ways you can request refills your prescriptions without having to come into one of our facilities.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Online:</strong> You can use My Health<em>e</em>Vet at <a href="http://www.myhealthevet.va.gov/">www.myhealthevet.va.gov</a> to refill your VA prescriptions and view your VA prescription history online. </li>\n\t<li><strong>Mail Order:</strong> Medication refills can be requested by mailing the refill notice provided to you at the time of your original fill.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Telephone: </strong>Call our Automated Refill Line at <strong>302-633-5484</strong>.</li>\n</ul>',
